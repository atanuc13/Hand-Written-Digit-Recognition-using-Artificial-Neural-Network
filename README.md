# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition-using-Artificial-Neural-Network

In this assignment we will do handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset with the help
of Artificial Neural Network(ANN). First we will train the neural network with different image
samples with resolution of 28 x 28. Then the networkâ€™s performance will be evaluated in terms
of test accuracy with respect to different network architecture with single or multiple layers of
neurons with some optimization and regularization techniques.
