# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition-using-Artificial-Neural-Network

In this assignment I have done handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset with the help
of Artificial Neural Network(ANN). First we trained the neural network with different image
samples with resolution of 28 x 28. Then the networkâ€™s performance will be evaluated in terms
of test accuracy with respect to different network architecture with single or multiple layers of
neurons with some optimization and regularization techniques.
